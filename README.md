# Coding challenge from ww

There are 3 questions total. The files are divided as following:

```
Q1: q1.rb, dict(sample dictionary file)
Q2: q2.rb, page_base.rb 
Q3: q3.rb
```

All 3 questions should be executed from commandline, ie.:
```
ruby q1.rb dict
ruby q2.rb
ruby q3.rb 5
```
All output is in stdout. This is implemented in ruby-2.4.2p198.
